# Mars

It’s Mars on your phone. This React Native application calls NASA’s mars rover mission api, and formats the returned JSON for your red planet exploration needs.

## Purpose for building the application:
   Simply, to personally use and explore the features of react native in practice. 

## Application features:
   * View lists of stunning images from NASA’s mars rover mission.
   * Select through each mission SOL Date (Solar date) to view images from.
   * Filter which cameras’ images you want to see.

## Planned application features:
   * Complete full screen of image after selection from the list.
	     Possibly with more info on the image it’s self.
   * Some extra animation integration to finish the design brief.
   * A page to credit NASA’s Mars rover mission, and all the skilled people at JPL.


## React Native and general programing features and concepts I’ve learned and worked with so far:

* JavaScript classes.
* The React Native component life cycle.
* Props, and passing props.
* Component state.
* Function calls, and passing props to and with them.
* JavaScript switches.
* A touch of animation through the Animated API supplied with React Native.
* API calls, and data handling.
* JSON interpretation, and handling.
* JavaScript debugging in Chrome.
* Library importing and use with in React Native.
* light amounts of style work using Layout props.
* Git.

## React Native and general programming features and concepts I plan to work with next:
* A lot more Layout prop features.
* The Animated API.
* Font (worked with it already, but have not implemented it yet.)


## End goals:
To have the application ready and approved for the App Store.


## Notes to the user:
Some of the SOL dates and camera options do not bring back any images, keep this in mind if your selection results in a dry off-black screen.
The images taken on this mission may be some of the first few products made on mars. Neat.
